# Github issues

This is our reproduction play ground. Some of these bugs are really hard to
reproduce using a test suite as they require a lot of different variables to
expose a certain edge case. Most of these could require interaction of
a browser/human in order to trigger these. So there isn't a way of automating
these tests.
